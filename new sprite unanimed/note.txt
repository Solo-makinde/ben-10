I kept running into an issue when I got the other sprites online I couldn't animate it properly, I would either lose resolution because I got it as an entire  sprite sheet and had to remove it separately
I could not animate it because when i did there was a different in size. the walk animation was not correct because each framed would be noticeably bigger than the other.
there was a noticeable difference between when I asked the character to be idle and when i asked it to move.

so i chose to use pivot animator to make the characters so i could manually create their movements and make the sprites myself. making this on pivot animator was a lot harder than I thought and used a bunch of videos and references, i scrapped it because it did not have the cartoony feeling and colors i needed for the game feel.

this is unfinished, i made an attack pattern for vilgax

stretch goal attack pattern for vilgax,
